# AI-Powered Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Optimisation

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Internet of Things (IoT)** technologies to optimise pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, particularly for the production of **Atorvastatin**. The goal is to enhance the efficiency, quality control, and maintenance of manufacturing processes using AI-driven predictive maintenance, real-time process optimisation, and automated quality assurance systems.

## Features

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Using AI and IoT sensors to monitor equipment in real-time, predicting failures before they occur, and reducing downtime.
- **Process Optimisation**: AI-based optimisation algorithms to enhance efficiency, improve reaction yields, and minimise raw material waste.
- **Quality Control**: Real-time monitoring of product quality using AI-based anomaly detection techniques to ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: SimPy, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, etc.
- **Tools**: Google Colab (for simulation), GitHub (version control)

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pkaysantana/AI-Powered-Pharma-Optimisation.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Powered-Pharma-Optimization
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the simulation scripts. For example:

```bash
python simulate_sensor_data.py
